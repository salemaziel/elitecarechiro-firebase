## ðŸš€ This site is built with GatsbyJS using ReactJS

1.  **Editing a Gatsby site.**

    Make sure to have gatsby-cli installed

    ```sh
    
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Clone this repo from github**
  Obviously replace REPO_OWNER_USERNAME and REPO_NAME with the actual username and repo name from the url

    ```sh
    
    git clone https://github.com/REPO_OWNER_USERNAME/REPO_NAME
    ```

<!--    Log in to firebase console and replace the config from `firebaseConfig.js` with your settings.  -->

3.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd elitecarechiro-firebase/
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

<!-- The below is only relevant for/if using firebase for more than just auth

5.  **Make dynamic pages**

    Open `templates.js` and add your dynamic pages like this:

    ```js
    [
      {
        path: '/post',
        collection: 'posts',
        param: 'title',
        context: ['title', 'description'],
        fileName: 'post',
      },
    ];
    ```

    1. **`path`** is the url of the page, for example `test.com/post`

    2. **`collection`** is the name of the collection from firestore, at build time this starter will retrieve and make pages with all the documents from this collection

    3. **`param`** the parameter from url, the equivalent of `/post/:param` in `React Router`

    4. **`context`** the fields from the collection that will be requested at `build` time, then you can access the data from `this.props.pageContext`. For example for this `context: ['title', 'description'],` you'll be able to get the data from here:

    ```js
    const {
      pageContext: { title, description },
    } = this.props;
    ```

    5. **`filename`** the name of the file from `templates` folder that you'll use to render the data from that collection
